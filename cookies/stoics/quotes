itself, but to your estimate of it — and this you have the power to revoke at

"Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must
believe that you are being harmed. If someone succeeds in provoking you,
realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation. Which is why it is
essential that we not respond impulsively to impressions; take a moment before
reacting, and you will find it easier to maintain control."

"Self-respect is a discipline, a habit of mind that can never be faked but can
be developed, trained, coaxed forth. It was once suggested to me that, as an
antidote to crying, I put my head in a paper bag. As it happens, there is a
sound physiological reason, something to do with oxygen, for doing exactly that,
but the psychological effect alone is incalculable: it is difficult in the
extreme to continue fancying oneself Cathy in Wuthering Heights with one’s head
in a Food Fair bag. There is a similar case for all the small disciplines,
unimportant in themselves; imagine maintaining any kind of swoon, commiserative
or carnal, in a cold shower."
