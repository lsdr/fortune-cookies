itself, but to your estimate of it — and this you have the power to revoke at

"Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must
 believe that you are being harmed. If someone succeeds in provoking you,
 realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation. Which is why it is
 essential that we not respond impulsively to impressions; take a moment before
 reacting, and you will find it easier to maintain control."

 the source from which self-respect springs.”

  -- Joan Didion
%
"Self-respect is a discipline, a habit of mind that can never be faked but can
 be developed, trained, coaxed forth. It was once suggested to me that, as an
 antidote to crying, I put my head in a paper bag. As it happens, there is a
 sound physiological reason, something to do with oxygen, for doing exactly
 that, but the psychological effect alone is incalculable: it is difficult in
 the extreme to continue fancying oneself Cathy in Wuthering Heights with
 one’s head in a Food Fair bag. There is a similar case for all the small
 disciplines, unimportant in themselves; imagine maintaining any kind of swoon,
 commiserative or carnal, in a cold shower."

"The soul is like a bowl of water, and our impressions are like the ray of
 light falling upon the water. When the water is troubled, it appears that the
 light itself is moved too, but it isn't. So, when a person loses their
 composure it isn't their skill and virtues that are troubled, but the spirit
 in which they exist, and when that spirit calms down so do those things."

"Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather
 must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned
 by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to
 life he can only respond by being responsible."
