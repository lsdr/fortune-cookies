"Logic is indifferent to truth. The goal of logic is to root out inconsistent
 beliefs and generate new beliefs consistent with the original set. Logic does
 not consider whether our beliefs are true.
 
 A logical person can be wrong in everything she or he believes and still be
 consistent."

 given the knowledge available can still turn out unhappily."
